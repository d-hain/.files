# My dotfiles

Here all my currently used dotfiles. \
You can find my current setup (install script) [here](https://github.com/d-hain/arch_hyprland_install).

# Cloning

If you also want to have [my nvim config](https://github.com/d-hain/init.lua) use this command:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/d-hain/dotfiles
```
