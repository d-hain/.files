# My dotfiles

Here all my currently used dotfiles (even if I don't really use all tools in here actively). \
If there is some config that only works for a specific operating system then it is located in a folder named after it.

# Cloning

If you also want to have [my nvim config](https://github.com/d-hain/init.lua) use this command:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/d-hain/dotfiles
```
