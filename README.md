# My dotfiles

In the root folder there are all general configs that I would use everywhere.\
Things like a .vimrc or a .zshrc.

The next layer of folders is a operating system that I use.\
In there are all config files used specifically for that OS.

Then there are color schemes.\
And in there all custom config files.
